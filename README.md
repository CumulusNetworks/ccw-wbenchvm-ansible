##About

The Cumulus Workbench VM Ansible Playbook is responsible for provisioning a clean Ubuntu image into a workable mgmt VM for a Cumulus Workbench reservation.

This playbook may be used in a Vagrantfile to provision a Ubuntu Vagrant VM so a user can test and install Cumulus [cldemo packages](http://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo)

## Requirements:
* VM with an 2nd interface with IP 192.168.0.1/24. This is simple to provision
  in vagrant using the private network option. This is required to get
  cldemo debs to install properly


## Example Vagrant File
```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "fgrehm/trusty64-lxc"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.0.1", lxc__bridge_name:
'lxcbr1'

  config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "/home/user/ccw-wbenchvm-ansible/site.yml"
  end
end
```
